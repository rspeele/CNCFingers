-- Important settings. 
-- Should definitely review these before generating your G-Code.

-- What is the native unit of the machine?
machine.unit = mm

-- How big is the board we're cutting?
board.width = 6 inches
board.thickness = 0.25 inches

-- Note that the size of a finger is determined by both board.width and finger.count.
-- Finger count includes both ups and downs, so for example
-- the below diagram represents output from finger.count = 6
--
--             2   4   6

finger.count = 6

-- If the workpiece is longer than your machine's cutting area, you might have to
-- make your fingers in multiple passes, moving another section of the board into the
-- cutting area each time. If so, set multipass to "yes", to disable the parts of the G-Code that
-- cut off the extra corners on finger cutouts that touch the "end" of the board width.
finger.multipass = no

-- Whatcha cutting your board with? It should be an end mill, but what size?
-- What feedrate and depth of cut are you OK with?

tool.diameter = 0.125 inches
tool.depthofcut = 0.05 inches
tool.feedrate = 30 in/min
tool.plungerate = 15 in/min

--------------------------------------------------------
-- Unimportant/constant settings.
-- Shouldn't be necessary to change these in most cases.
--------------------------------------------------------

-- Step over X times the diameter of the bit for each carving pass.
tool.stepover = 0.2

-- When ramping down while plunging, ramp over a distance X times the diameter of the bit.
tool.rampfactor = 2.0

-- Scale feed rate up to this time the base, proportionally with the depth of cut.
-- I.E. a cut half the specified tool.depthofcut could feed 2x faster, but this
-- cap prevents a cut 1/10 of tool.depthofcut from moving 10x faster.
tool.maxscalefeedrate = 2.0

-- Gap on the sides of the fingers.
finger.sideallowance = 4 thou

-- Gap on the ends of the fingers.
finger.endallowance = 4 thou

-- How far below the board to go. You should have your board mounted on a "spoil board" that you're ok with
-- cutting into. But in case you don't, this is set to 0 by default. Change it to a few thou if you know what you're
-- doing and have a spoil board, you'll get better results.
finger.spoildepth = 0 thou

-- If you're cutting big fingers, the toolpath leaves a block in the interior of the cut. Eventually this gets
-- completely separated from the board, or at least (depending on your spoildepth setting) there will be only a very
-- thin "onion skin" connecting it to the board. It will flop around and break off easily. Usually this is a non-issue
-- but occasionally the tool can catch on the floppy waste piece and jam it up against the board, potentially moving
-- the board slightly if it's not very securely clamped. Therefore it can be good to explicitly program in a step
-- to "kick out" the waste piece when the onion skin is thin. CNCFingers will do that on the Z-axis pass when the onion
-- skin thickness becomes less than or equal to this setting, if this setting is greater than 0.
finger.kickout = 5 thou

-- If cutting soft wood, you want to make some trimming passes to clean up fuzz on the dado. This will otherwise
-- interfere with the fit or at minimum look ugly. The trim pass depth should be very low, just enough to touch the fuzz
-- and separate it from the wood.
finger.fuzzcut = 1 thou

-- Rotate/mirror the G-code for different job setups.
-- Default is no rotation. Fingers will be cut left-to-right along the front of the board
-- facing the machine operator, like so:

gcode.transform = identity

---- To cut front-to-back along the right edge of the board you could rotate 270 degrees clockwise:
-- gcode.transform = clockwise270

---- You an also combine transforms. For example, to cut back-to-front on the left edge, a 90* clockwise
---- rotation would work, but if you wanted to cut front-to-back, you could flip the Y axis too:
-- gcode.transform = clockwise90, mirrorY
